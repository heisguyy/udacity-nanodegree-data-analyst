## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, It was recorded that the there are a lot more poorer people than rich people and most people have salaries in between 25000 and 74999. It was also noticed the number of chargedoff loans is about a quarter of the settled loans. Most loans are also Rated C. Poor people have higher tendencies of defaulting on a loan or giving bad debts, this further reflects on the rating and availablity of loans. Thereby puting the rich at an advantage. There is also a very high correlation the cost of a loan and the estimated loss if the loan is chargedoff. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the effects of levels of income on loans. 
I started by showing that rich people tend to pay their loans by showing a decreasing trend in defaulted and charged off loans as we go higher in income levels. I moved on to showing that lenders know it by showing how a trend ratings of loans given to people in different levels of income.  After that, I went to show that the lender took the smart business choice of offering cheaper loans to the rich by showing a trend in the cost of loans across different levels of income. Finally, I showed how the rich are taking advantage of it by take more and bigger loans than their poor counterparts.
